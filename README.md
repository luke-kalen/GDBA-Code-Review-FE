# GDBA Front End Code Review

## This code is from a previous git branch, not the actual, current project. I was not permitted to provide that code for propreitary reason. Therefore, some features are not complete. However, it is in good enough condition to showcase my coding style, as well as present the code running in the DOM.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

Testing changes to this again.
